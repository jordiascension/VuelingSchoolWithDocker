   The main form is VuelingForms
    Shows a combobox with a list of spanish provinces using singleton pattern
    Also, has a datagridview with a list of students. Shows some attributes but its Guid (deliverately hidded)
    This grid is filled deserializing a XML and lets add a new item on AddForm, using delegate / event to communicate between two different clases. And persists the changes invoking a file repository done previously
